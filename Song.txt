Lyrics:Oh, tell me that dark could never win the light
Oh, tell me that wrong could never win the right
Baby, tell me that we gon' someday stop the fight
And tell me that every, everything gon' be alright
Oh tell me who’s stupid, baby, is it me or them?
Just tell me who’s insane, baby, is it me or them?
In this crazy world after patience, could we get the pearl?
But this world, which teaches me, preaches me how to curl
Oh, fuck the school
All we got is mad teachers and some visible classes
Divided spaces, and forever-lastin' stresses
Everybody’s mad
Kill people with fingers on Twitter
More than a gun, more than a knife
The tip of your tongue just glitter
